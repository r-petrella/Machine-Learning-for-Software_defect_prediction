# Software_defect_prediction
Please Read the Project Description for an in-depth look at the abstract.

Description: Machine Learning applied to Software Defect Prediction (SDP) on the public “NASA Software-defects dataset” with Python.

Aim: to replicate the results obtained in a paper and measure the accuracy of the used classifiers to predict the binary response SDP with vs without Feature Selection.

Used Algorithms: classifiers: Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and K-NN. Types of Feature Selection: Information Gain and the Genetic Selection Algorithm.

Remark: please note that in this project 5 datasets are used for both training and testing different software modules. Their format is .arff. The .csv files are just the results which express the accuracies computed with the 4 classifers among the 5 datasets.
